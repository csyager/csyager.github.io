Going into my fourth year, one of the biggest yearly difficulties I faced was rush voting.  This is a process that can take legitimately up to 6 hours in each of the four rounds of voting, most of which occur on weeknights where the brothers have class the next day.  Rush is an essential process for a fraternity, as our existence and financial security rest solely on our ability to recruit new members.  While we had a system in place to track people coming through the door, it was clear to me that our system could be improved.

Notably, there was no electronic system in place for voting.  This was by and large the biggest time sink in the entire process.  Voting is usually conducted by raise of hand or by placing votes in a bag.  This process was not efficient, and was one that I felt I could help optimize.  Challenges involved were making sure that every brother was able to access the site, that their votes and interactions with the rushees would be counted distinctly and attributed to their user accounts, and combining various technologies to make sure that we were tracking essential information on each of the rushees, including a picture of themselves that they take at the door and their contact information.  To do this, I used the Django framework, because I was familiar with it through my coursework, and because it handles a lot of the user account stuff natively.
