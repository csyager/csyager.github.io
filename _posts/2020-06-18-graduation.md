A little over a month ago I gratuated from the University of Virginia.  Because of the COVID-19 epidemic, this event didn't go exactly as planned.  While I was still able to be in Charlottesville to celebrate, my family wasn't able to join me, and the celebrations were slightly less formal.  That being said, it was really great to have an opportunity to reflect on everything that I've done and how much I've changed over the past four years.  UVA has meant a lot to me, and having that chance to reflect really put into perspective that the next phase of my life was ready to begin.

The next phase has been coming slowly though.  The job that I had waiting for me at the end of the summer has been pushed back a bit, possibly as far as this winter.  It's certainly not how I had hoped my "adult" life would start, but I've been trying to make the most of it.  It's given me a chance to reflect on the mistakes I made in school, as well as the lessons I learned from them.  I don't mean this in a pessimistic way though.  I'm really grateful for all the opportunities I had to live outside of my comfort zone.  Sometimes I lived too far outside of it, and I stumbled, but even those experiences taught me something, and at the end of the day I'm grateful for them.  

All of that being said, I think I'm ready for the next big thing.  It's really easy to fall into nostalgia for what life was like at school, and I will cherish these years fondly.  But I'm ready for a new adventure, and I'm glad that I can move forward with that clarity.  In a way, this break has been very therapeutic, and given me a chance to center myself before embarking on the next journey.  I'm definitely getting antsy though, and really want to get started with adult life.
