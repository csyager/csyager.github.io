        <title>Power of Difference Assessment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.com/uva-cp-1920/The_Sum&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://travis-ci.com/uva-cp-1920/The_Sum.svg?token=SyrFHx8gYJaW1KCbD5sw&amp;amp;branch=master&quot; alt=&quot;Build Status&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the UVA engineering curriculum, all fourth year students are required to complete a capstone project, meant to be the culmination of what they have learned over their four years.  For computer science students, this meant that we would be creating a project based on the requirements and specifications of a client, who was not necessarily of a technical background.  At the beginning of the year several clients came to our classroom to pitch their projects to us, and we ranked our favorite choices to find a match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My project was with a nonprofit in the Charlottesville area called The Sum.  The Sum’s stated goal is to stand in solidarity with all people, and to take strides towards a more just and equitable world for people of all backgrounds.  One of their offerings towards this end is the Power of Difference Assessment, which is an online assessment that helps identify implicit biases.  By first answering 19 demographics questions and then rating their agreement or disagreement to 70 statements, consultants at The Sum can collect enough data to have a meaningful conversation with the assessment taker about their implicit biases and how they can combat them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our job was to take the existing system, which was thrown together somewhat haphazardly using some Javascript and HTML, and create a new system that could scale to thousands of users so the assessment could be used for institutional studies.  In its original form, the assessment could only handle one test taker at a time, and relied heavily on the consultants at The Sum to collect the data manually when they were done before they could compile a report on the results.  This obviously wouldn’t work if thousands of people were taking the assessment, so we had to automate everything from starting the test and collecting basic contact information from the user to scheduling consultations when the assessment was over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project resonated with me in a lot of ways.  First, being interested in consulting it was fun to be working with a client.  I find that the most enjoyable parts of engineering are not when I have to sit by myself and grind on work quietly, but when I can interact with others and toss ideas around and generally collaborate to make something cool.  Having a non-technical client kind of forced our team to do that.  Secondly, being interested in web development it was fun to take our requirements and really build out an improvement that could scale to a bigger user base.  None of the projects I had worked on in class or for fun had ever had a very big user base, so it always felt kind of amateurish.  Intentionally designing a system that could support so many users felt very professional, and gave me a confidence boost that I could work on large and scalable projects.  Lastly, working with a nonprofit with such a just purpose brought some satisfaction as well.  Having taken the assessment several times, I feel that it really is different from any other “bias test” out there, and I believe that the work being done at The Sum has a lot of value.  Implicit biases are everywhere in our world, and they’re extremely dangerous.  Working on the project felt like working to eliminate them, which was something I really enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A little over a month ago I gratuated from the University of Virginia.  Because of the COVID-19 epidemic, this event didn’t go exactly as planned.  While I was still able to be in Charlottesville to celebrate, my family wasn’t able to join me, and the celebrations were slightly less formal.  That being said, it was really great to have an opportunity to reflect on everything that I’ve done and how much I’ve changed over the past four years.  UVA has meant a lot to me, and having that chance to reflect really put into perspective that the next phase of my life was ready to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The next phase has been coming slowly though.  The job that I had waiting for me at the end of the summer has been pushed back a bit, possibly as far as this winter.  It’s certainly not how I had hoped my “adult” life would start, but I’ve been trying to make the most of it.  It’s given me a chance to reflect on the mistakes I made in school, as well as the lessons I learned from them.  I don’t mean this in a pessimistic way though.  I’m really grateful for all the opportunities I had to live outside of my comfort zone.  Sometimes I lived too far outside of it, and I stumbled, but even those experiences taught me something, and at the end of the day I’m grateful for them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;All of that being said, I think I’m ready for the next big thing.  It’s really easy to fall into nostalgia for what life was like at school, and I will cherish these years fondly.  But I’m ready for a new adventure, and I’m glad that I can move forward with that clarity.  In a way, this break has been very therapeutic, and given me a chance to center myself before embarking on the next journey.  I’m definitely getting antsy though, and really want to get started with adult life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Delta Sig Rush Site</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/csyager/deltasigrush&quot;&gt;Click here to view the source code on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going into my fourth year, one of the biggest yearly difficulties I faced was rush voting.  This is a process that can take legitimately up to 6 hours in each of the four rounds of voting, most of which occur on weeknights where the brothers have class the next day.  Rush is an essential process for a fraternity, as our existence and financial security rest solely on our ability to recruit new members.  While we had a system in place to track people coming through the door, it was clear to me that our system could be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, there was no electronic system in place for voting.  This was by and large the biggest time sink in the entire process.  Voting is usually conducted by raise of hand or by placing votes in a bag.  This process was not efficient, and was one that I felt I could help optimize.  Challenges involved were making sure that every brother was able to access the site, that their votes and interactions with the rushees would be counted distinctly and attributed to their user accounts, and combining various technologies to make sure that we were tracking essential information on each of the rushees, including a picture of themselves that they take at the door and their contact information.  To do this, I used the Django framework, because I was familiar with it through my coursework, and because it handles a lot of the user account stuff natively.  This meant that I would be able to get a lot done without spending too much time on the little things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insofar as meeting the stated goals of the project, the application was a big success.  Our tedious voting process was sped up a lot, and rush was conducted more efficiently all around.  There were also lessons learned though, and certainly room for improvement.  On one of the first nights of voting, we had a big problem with how long the site was taking to load, because we hadn’t tested it with so much data in the database before.  As it turns out, I had mistakenly saved a pretty sizable chunk of useless data that was originally stored when rushees took their pictures on the first night.  When many rushees were being loaded at once, this created a huge bottleneck on our process.  Fortunately, after a few hours of looking over the code I diagnosed the problem and fixed it before our next round of voting, but I learned an important lesson along the way about scaling when handling redundant data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the project worked so well for rush, I was asked if we could expand it to handle other fraternity functions, like our social events.  This expansion of functions is a project that I’m still working on, and have adapted into my GreekLink project that I talk about in another post.  But it’s been a lot of fun building this system for a group of my friends, which have been like a microcosm of a userbase.  The project taught me a lot about soliciting requirements and working with a nontechncial “client” of sorts, and I hope that the site I built can continue to be useful for our chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GreekLink</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.com/csyager/greeklink-core&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://travis-ci.com/csyager/greeklink-core.svg?branch=master&quot; alt=&quot;Build Status&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GreekLink is a software project a few friends and I have been working on.  At my fraternity chapter, we traditionally spend a lot of time conducting rush voting.  It’s a huge hassle, having to vote on every person that walks through the doors, with each of the four rounds of voting taking usually between 3 and 6 hours.  We used a web application designed by an alumni that wasn’t particularly user-friendly, and was in need of some improved tools to increase productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix these issues, I volunteered to redesign the site, with the primary goal being that we could conduct voting electronically.  In the past, voting was conducted by either a show of hands or the placing of chips in a bag.  These processes both took a matter of minutes to conduct, and my goal was to reduce this operation to a matter of seconds.  To do this, I designed a highly interactive web application using the Django python framework.  The site was deployed using Heroku, and managed everything involved in rush, from the scheduling of events to rushees signing in at the door to track attendance to the voting itself.  When it came time to conduct voting, rushees were pulled from our database of people who had attended the events, and users could place their votes on their phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there were a few hiccups to work through as we pushed the boundaries of how much load the application could handle from time to time, it eventually got to a point where things were running really smoothly.  So smoothly, in fact, that we decided to expand the site to include features for planning and managing social events throughout the semester.  This got my friends and I thinking, and we reached the conclusion that we could create a one-stop-shop for all of the people-management, planning, and communication that goes into running a Greek organization and sell the product for profit.  Thus, GreekLink was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is still a work in progress, many of the systems that were thrown together haphazardly for the initial product that my fraternity used have been deeply refined and polished.  We’ve been looking into elastic hosting options that will allow us to scale out to meet the needs of mulitple Greek organizations, and will hopefully even be able to facilitate communication amongst the community through our application.  This project has been a lot of fun, and I’m excited to see where it will go next.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Site</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to the technical difficulties involved in maintaining the old version of connoryager.com, I’ve decided to mostly rebuild it and utilize the tools offered by Jekyll and Github to learn something new and make it a little simpler.  While my old blog was a lot of fun the maintenance of it was getting a little too much to handle.  The old site was run using an Apache server running on an old laptop in my parents house on a wireless connection to the router, where I had forwarded all HTTP and HTTPS requests to the laptop.  This was a lot of fun to setup, but not so much fun to fix everytime my mom unplugged the laptop to run the vacuum cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old site was a lot of fun though.  Basically every time I learned a new technology or technique, either in classes or that I taught myself, I would try to implement it on the site.  For example, I was pretty excited when I learned a bunch about running a database in my internship after my first year, so I set the site up with a database that would store comments and allow users to sign in.  Then my third year I took an intro to cybersecurity class that had a unit on SQL injections, and I realized that just using simple text input fields without sanitizing inputs was really not a very good idea.  So I fixed that up.  Then I realized I was overpaying massively for the services my hosting company was providing, so I decided to set up my own home server.  This learning by trial and error and using the site as a way to practice what I learned as I learned it was a lot of fun, and has contributed massively to my interest in web development.  But alas, it became a little too complex for its own good, and the maintenance on my end and the usability on the user’s end was becoming too weighed down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SO, I am starting from scatch using the cheapest and most efficient technology I could find.  GitHub is a service I’m already familiar with, and just pushing to deploy a static site is a pretty intriguing concept.  It’s gonna take a little time for me to make this one as catchy and colorful as the last one, but hopefully as I go this will become more useful as a portfolio.  If you’re coming from the old connoryager.com, welcome to connoryager.com-2.0!  Thanks for checking in!  Otherwise, thanks for taking the time to visit the site and I hope you find it a pleasant stay.&lt;/p&gt;
